## Setup

See `.tool-versions` for the required Erlang/OTP and rebar3 versions
(install via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) or
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arizona-framework/roadrunner_nova.git
cd roadrunner_nova
make compile
```

## Workflow

One command covers day-to-day development:

- **`make test`** (or `make precommit`, or `rebar3 precommit`) — run
  before every commit and before pushing. Formats-check Erlang via
  `erlfmt`, compiles, runs xref + hank + dialyzer, runs the eunit +
  Common Test suites with cover, fails if line
  coverage drops below 100 %, and builds the docs. CI runs the same
  command.

`make help` lists every target. Common ones:

- `make compile` / `make doc` / `make fmt`
- `make eunit` / `make ct` / `make dialyzer` / `make xref` / `make hank` (individual stages)
- `make clean` / `make distclean`

You can also invoke `rebar3 <task>` directly (the Makefile is just a
thin wrapper over the same targets). See `rebar.config` for the full
alias list.

## License

roadrunner_nova is licensed under the [Apache License Version 2.0](LICENSE.md), for all code.

## Reporting a bug

roadrunner_nova is not perfect software and will be buggy.

Bugs can be reported via
[GitHub issues: bug report](https://github.com/arizona-framework/roadrunner_nova/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

Some contributors and maintainers may be unpaid developers working on roadrunner_nova, in their own time,
with limited resources. We ask for respect and understanding, and will provide the same back.

If your contribution is an actual bug fix, we ask you to include tests that, not only show the issue
is solved, but help prevent future regressions related to it.

## Requesting or implementing a feature

Before requesting or implementing a new feature, do the following:

- search, in existing [issues](https://github.com/arizona-framework/roadrunner_nova/issues) (open or closed),
whether the feature might already be in the works, or has already been rejected,
- make sure you're using the latest software release (or even the latest code, if you're going for
_bleeding edge_).

If this is done, open up a
[GitHub issues: feature request](https://github.com/arizona-framework/roadrunner_nova/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

We may discuss details with you regarding the implementation, and its inclusion within the project.

We try to have as many of roadrunner_nova's features tested as possible. Everything that a user can do,
and is repeatable in any way, should be tested, to guarantee backwards compatible.

## Submitting your changes

### Code Style

- run `rebar3 fmt` (also part of the `precommit` gate) — `erlfmt`
  enforces no trailing whitespace, 4-space indentation, and a
  100-character soft line limit
- write small functions whenever possible, and use descriptive names for functions and variables
- comment tricky or non-obvious decisions made to explain their rationale
- prefer modern OTP idioms — sigils for binary literals (`~"..."`),
  triple-quoted multi-line strings (`"""..."""`), `maybe` expressions
  for nested case chains, body recursion (cons on the way out) over
  `lists:reverse(Acc)`, binary keys for wire-derived data (no
  `binary_to_atom` on parsed names)

### Committing your changes

Merging to the `main` branch will usually be preceded by a squash.

Commit messages use a plain imperative subject line — no
`feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:` semantic prefixes. Subject only, no body
unless the change genuinely needs explanation (a one-line subject
beats a paragraph of preamble).

While it's OK (and expected) for your commit messages to relate the
*why* of a given change, be aware that the final commit (the merge
one) will be the PR title — so make it specific. This also helps
automated changelog generation.

### Pull requests and branching

All fixes to roadrunner_nova end up requiring a +1 from one or more of the project's maintainers.

During the review process, you may be asked to correct or edit a few things before a final rebase
to merge things. Do send edits as individual commits to allow for gradual and partial reviews to be
done by reviewers.
